The contents of the file 'workbench.colorCustomizations--yyyy.MM.dduHHmm.txt' are suitable for insertion into the VSCode file 'settings.json' (Copy/Paste file contents), provided that the contents of 'workbench.colorCustomizations--yyyy.MM.dduHHmm.txt' are pasted in-between the opening curly-brace, and the closing curly-brace of the file 'settings.json'.

Some settings take effect immediately, but some settings require that you first 'Reload' Visual Studio Code [Ctrl/Cmd]+[R] before the new setting takes effect.'
