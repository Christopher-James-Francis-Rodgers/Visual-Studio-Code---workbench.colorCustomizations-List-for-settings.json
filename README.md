# Visual-Studio-Code---workbench.colorCustomizations-List-for-settings.json

The file workbench.colorCustomizations--yyyy.MM.dduHHmm.txt is a Replication and Modification of page:

'Theme Colors' (for Visual Studio Code [VSCode]) 
https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color] 

The contents of the file 'workbench.colorCustomizations--yyyy.MM.dduHHmm.txt' are suitable for insertion into the VSCode file 'settings.json' (Copy/Paste file contents), provided that the contents of 'workbench.colorCustomizations--yyyy.MM.dduHHmm.txt' are pasted in-between the opening curly-brace, and the closing curly-brace of the file 'settings.json'.

All color settings listed on the visualstudio.com page are in the order they were found on that page, but I added additional headings for ease of finding a desired setting, or set of settings.

Each separate color setting is ready to use after you define its color (Eg: #rrggbb), and then un-comment its line by removing the two forward-slach characters at the beginning of that setting's line-- at which point it becomes active.

Some settings take effect immediately, but some settings require that you first 'Reload' Visual Studio Code [Ctrl/Cmd]+[R] before the new setting takes effect.'
